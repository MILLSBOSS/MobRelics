# EggDrops Configuration
#
# Set per-mob drop chances (in percent) for spawn eggs when a player kills the mob.
# 0.0 disables drops for that mob. Any non-zero value is clamped to the range [0.01, 100.0].
#
# Mobs are organized by dimension. Entries will be auto-populated here the first time the
# plugin runs with only valid mobs that have vanilla spawn eggs.

# Overworld mobs and their drop chances
overworld: {}

# Nether mobs and their drop chances
nether: {}

# End mobs and their drop chances
end: {}
